# Minimal TypeScript Starter

Useful for small tests or demos.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start a dev server

## VSCode Integration

I've included my recommended extensions and settings within the `.vscode` directory for automatic linting and formatting. Delete it and adjust the ESLint and Prettier configs accordingly to match your setup.

## Building for Production

Run `npm run build` to build to the `public` directory and `npm run serve` to serve it.

## Acknowledgement

The foundation of this starter was based off of [Stephanie Eckles' starter](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/). She has many great articles and projects that I recommend checking out!
